# Issues

GitHub issues will be used to track everything from bug reports to suggestions and ideas.  Please follow the rules below when submitting an issue or enhancement request.  Also, please try to provide a meaningful title for your issue as it will be the first thing anyone sees.

## Bug reports

Before you submit a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if it hasn't already been reported.

Please include the following details in your issue description:
* What operating system did you first experience the problem on 
* What browser you were using at the time
* What version of the browser did you use
* A description of the problem that enables anyone to try and recreate the behavior
* What you expected to happen

Your issue may also include the following details:
* Screenshots which may help explain the issue further
* Any messages listed in your browser's console

## Enhancements

Before you submit a new enhancement request, please search the existing issues/enhancements to see if it hasn't already been suggested.

If you have an interest in your enhancement being completed, please take part in the discussion of your suggestions and/or provide a pull request which provides a way to resolve your enhancement request.

# Issue Culling

## Reasons to close issues

There are any number of reasons that your issue might be closed.  Here are some examples:

* Your issue is no longer valid.  Either the issue couldn't be reproduced or is in any other way incompatable with the current direction of the product.
* Your issue is stale.  While valid and reproducible bugs should stick around until completion, some lose feature requests or suggestions may lose relevancy overtime if/when no one works on them.  At which point, your issue might be closed.

## Issue resolution

Issues won't be assigned to any one person.  Instead, if you intend to work on an issue it's best to leave a comment about it.  Pull requests have much greater value and express intent to complete an issue.  The first correct pull request will be the pull request that will be merged.

# Pull Requests

Please mark pull requests that are still being worked on by adding `[DRAFT]` before the title, and remove it when it's ready to be reviewed.  

If your pull request fixes a issue listed on GitHub, please include the issue number (#???) and [link the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) in the description of the pull request, where ??? is the number of the issue.  

You can also use closing keywords in a commit message. The issue will be closed when you merge the commit into the default branch.  The list of closing keywords is shown below:

```
close

fix
fixes

resolve
